# The Pong Game


## About
--------

This is a classic Pong game implemented using Python's turtle module. The game features a simple gameplay where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The game is designed to be easy to play and fun to compete with friends and family.

## Gameplay
-----------

### Objective
The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth without missing it. The game continues until a player decides to quit.

### Controls
Players can control their paddles using the following keyboard controls:

* Right paddle: "Up" and "Down" keys
* Left paddle: "w" and "s" keys

### Scoring
If a player misses the ball, the other player scores a point. The game keeps track of the points scored by each player using a scoreboard.

### Game Over
The game continues until a player decides to quit. There is no winning condition, and the game can be played indefinitely.

## Technical Details
--------------------

### Graphics and Event Handling
The game uses Python's turtle module for graphics and event handling. The turtle module provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating graphics and handling user input.

### Game Logic
The game logic is implemented using a simple game loop that updates the screen and checks for collisions. The game loop runs at a fixed speed, and the game updates the screen and checks for collisions at each iteration.

### Collision Detection
The game uses a simple collision detection algorithm to detect collisions between the ball and the paddles. The algorithm checks if the ball is within a certain distance of the paddle, and if so, it bounces the ball off the paddle.

### Scoreboard
The game features a scoreboard that keeps track of the points scored by each player. The scoreboard is updated in real-time as the game is played.

## Files
--------

### main.py
The main game file that contains the game logic and implementation.

### paddle.py
A module that defines the Paddle class, which represents a paddle in the game. The Paddle class provides methods for moving the paddle up and down, and for checking if the paddle has collided with the ball.

### ball.py
A module that defines the Ball class, which represents the ball in the game. The Ball class provides methods for moving the ball, bouncing the ball off the walls and paddles, and for checking if the ball has gone out of bounds.

### scoreboard.py
A module that defines the ScoreBoard class, which keeps track of the points scored by each player. The ScoreBoard class provides methods for updating the scoreboard and for displaying the scoreboard on the screen.

## Running the Game
-------------------

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` file using Python. The game will start, and you can play using the keyboard controls mentioned above.

### Requirements
The game requires Python 3.x and the turtle module to run. The game has been tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
